## Cool Space Pix
This lightweight site is to let you search NASA's image library for photos of all kinds of objects from space!

## Use
The page is short and intuitive. Just use the search conditions to determine what kind of results you're looking for, and click Submit to see your results!

## Technology
This is a fully front-end application, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Materialize CSS framework is used, as well as JQuery. Finally, the data powering the site itself - two APIs from NASA: the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and the NASA Image and Video Library.

The Spotify API was also used to provide atmospheric background music, but requires further development to work reliably for non-local users.
